"main" field of package.json
----------------------------

	Defines the entry point of a package when imported by name via a "node_modules" lookup. It's value is a path.
	When package is loaded with a bare specifier (the package name), it is resolved through "node_modules".

	It also defines the script that is used when the "package directory is loaded via require()" known as "Folders A Modules"
	//  This resolves to ./path/to/directory/index.js.
			require('./path/to/directory');


"exports" field of package.json
-------------------------------

The "exports" field allows defining the entry points of a package when imported by name loaded either via a node_modules lookup or a self-reference to its own name. 
It is supported in Node.js 12+ as an alternative to the "main" that can support defining subpath exports and conditional exports while encapsulating internal unexported modules.

Conditional Exports can also be used within "exports" to define different package entry points per environment, 
including whether the package is referenced via require or via import.

All paths defined in the "exports" must be relative file URLs starting with ./.
